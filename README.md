# Homework 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

This is the first homework for the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2024**. The goal is to perform data analysis and operations on a dataset of laptops.

## Project Overview
In this homework, we are working with a dataset of laptops to explore different aspects such as:
- Handling missing values
- Performing statistical operations
- Matrix computations

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about various laptops such as:
- Brand
- Model
- RAM
- Storage
- Screen size
- Price

## Tasks
1. **Count the number of unique brands**.
2. **Find the maximum final price of Dell laptops**.
3. **Handle missing values in the Screen column** by filling them with the most frequent value.
4. **Matrix operations**: Compute weights based on RAM, Storage, and Screen using matrix multiplication.


Run the provided Jupyter notebooks to perform the analysis.
